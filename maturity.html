                <h1>The Sign of Maturity Isn't A Sign</h1>

                <p> I used to have an entirely different take of what it meant to be mature. 
                    One day in the future, with the perfect amount of time, experience, and learning 
                    I’d transition into this person who just lived life effortlessly. This is a real vision 
                    I had for myself. And some days, I still kind of aspire to it if I’m being honest. 
                    Mostly because it’s a way to make me feel bad about myself. </br>

                    The truth I’ve actually discovered with time, experience, and learning, is that maturity isn’t 
                    about saying the right thing or fitting this image of who you think you should be. It’s about 
                    being comfortable with all these different parts of yourself, and not being afraid to bring 
                    all those parts with you, everywhere you go. Even in rooms where no one is really cheering for you. 
                    It’s about confronting the parts of you that change in certain situations and understanding why 
                    that is – and either being ok with it or not being ok with it. </br>
                
                The truth of maturity is allowing others to experience the parts of you that are a bit rough. 
                That have a bit of an edge, but open to being rounded out. If we continue to hide the edges, 
                we will continue to cut parts of ourselves out that deserve to see some light, to be nurtured, 
                    so that they get a fighting chance to grow into something you are proud of. </br>
                
                 The sign of maturity isn’t a finished product. Maturity is the state of bringing 
                    your whole self into a room and allowing your whole self to be experienced by others. 
                    This doesn’t mean being the loudest person in the room, nor the most extroverted. In 
                    my experience, it’s being your true, honest, self that cultivates into the kind 
                    of moments you want to have with people. And that’s what takes time, experience, and learning. 
                    The sign of maturity is not a sign, but a feeling you get from someone 
                    who understands themselves in such a way that creates a sense of liberation 
                    from external factors. Maybe the sign of maturity isn’t even a sign. </br>
